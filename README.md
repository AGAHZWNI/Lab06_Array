3. given an array of Integers `[1,10,22,44,5,13,19,23,99,9]` print all the even numbers
4. given an array of Integers `[1,10,22,44,5,13,19,23,99,9]` find the max number
5. given an array of Integers `[1,10,22,44,5,13,19,23,99,9]` find the min number
6. given an array of Integers `[1,10,22,44,5,13,19,23,99,9]` find the sum of all numbers
7. given an array of Integers `[1,10,22,44,5,13,19,23,99,9]` find the avg of all numbers
